# Day Streak: Social Fitness Tracker

Day Streak is a Next.js web application designed to help you build and maintain a consistent workout habit with your friends. It's a social-first platform where friendly competition and mutual support keep you motivated.

## Core Features

*   **Daily Activity Logging**: A simple, one-click button to log your workout for the day. Once you've logged your activity, a satisfying full-screen celebration animation confirms your achievement.
*   **Streak Tracking**: The app automatically calculates your streak of consecutive workout days. If your streak is greater than zero, it is prominently displayed within the app's logo (e.g., "5 Day Streak") to keep you motivated!
*   **Unified Group Leaderboard**: All users are part of a single, unified group. The "Group" tab displays a leaderboard showing every member's current streak, fostering a sense of community and friendly competition.
*   **Activity Calendar**: The dashboard features a personal calendar that visualizes your entire workout history, with completed days clearly marked.
*   **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up and sign-in functionality using Firebase Authentication. Each user gets a unique, fun cartoon avatar upon registration.
*   **Real-time Updates**: Built with Firebase Firestore, the app features real-time data synchronization, so all updates to the leaderboard and calendar appear instantly without needing a page refresh.
